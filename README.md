# hello-world
A tutorial repository I am using to learn GitHub, this dose not contain work for my portfolio.

I have some expriamce using version control in the past using 'Mercurial', however GitHub is diffrent enough I have to re-adjust and learn this new system.
That is why this repository won't have any of my coding work in it, it's just ment for me to learn how to use GitHub.
